		<h2>Swai Fish</h2>

<p>This is a fish that even a world class angler like Gerald Swindle wasn’t familiar with, but it’s become really popular because of its firm, white, flaky texture and most of all – it has just about zero fishy taste. The GMan loves it.</p>

<p>Prep time 15 minutes<br />
Cook time 10 minutes<br />
Servings 4</p>

<p>Indgredients:<br /> 
2 lbs Swahi Adobo All Purpose Seasoning Garlic Salt Old Bay Blackening Seasoning Red Pepper Jelly Pam Cooking Spray</p>

<p>Directions:<br /> 
Heat grill to 350 F Spray grill with Pam, place fish directly on grill season with all the seasonings. Cook for approximately 4 minutes, flip and season the other side, cook for approximately 3 minutes. Cover with red pepper jelly and allow the jelly to melt over fish.</p>
