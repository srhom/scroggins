/*
STYLING GUIDELINES

* Very little or no styling should be placed in this file. *

Please place styling in its appropriate location. We have partials
defined for most commom elements and stying should be organized as
such.

Take care to make sure not to repeat any styling declarations
unless absolutely necessary. For example, if you have multiple
elements that have a background-color: white then create a multi-
class selector that takes all of those elements and groups them
together into one style declaration/selector. For example:

.btn-white,
.bg-white,
.random_selector,
.header-top {
  background-color: white;
}

Please note that we're using Bourbon and Bitters for styling
elements, but we're using SASSGrid for all grid layouts.

* _extends.scss *
This is a place to define commonly used attributes so they can be
easily reused in other places using an @extend call. They should
be prefixed with a % so they are easily recognizable.

* _calls.scss *
This is where we define HIGHLY reused properties. Examples include
any selectors that have a position attribute, clearfix, display
block, display inline-block, etc.

* _backgrounds.scss *
All background-color or background-image attributes and any other
background related selectors should all be housed here.

* _borders.scss *
All border declarations should be defined here. Remember to attach
multiple selectors to the same style declaration and setup any
helpful variables to ensure consistant borders throughout the site.

* _typography.scss *
All typography-related styling should be here including font-family,
font-weight, font-style, line-height, color, etc.

* _z-index.scss *
Pretty self explanatory. This is where we'll store all z-index
properties. This will make it much easier to track down any layer
ordering issues that we come across.

* _layout.scss *
Any and all layout-related styling should be placed here. This
includes, but is not limited to columns/grid elements, margin,
padding, display, etc. We'll also be using this partial to store
all z-index properties.

* components/_*.scss *
These partials are used to store styling for specific elements of the
design. Examples include buttons, header, footer but the main
emphasis is on items that are commonly repeated throughout the
interface. We should be, whenever possible, trying to find a way to
reuse styles instead of defining new, custom declarations for
elements.

* _effects.scss *
The effects partial is where we'll store things like drop shadows,
text shadows, border-radius', opacity settings (though background
transparency should be stored in the backgrounds partial) and other
css "effects". Again, selectors should be added to existing style
declarations whenever possible instead of creating new declarations.
